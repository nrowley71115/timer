# timer
This app is pretty self explanatory. Do you want to track the time you spend doing something? This could work for you!

My .sh (shell) script works on my mac. I have ran into shell issues comparing linux to mac, so be aware of that. If you wanted to make this run on your linux or even Windows machine, I would recommend changing the timer.sh file into a python .py file.

The csv file is for simple storage. The headings are important so don't change those, but feel free to delete my rows of data. When you run timer.sh on your local machine it will populate data into timer.csv.
